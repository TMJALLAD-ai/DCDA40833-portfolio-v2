            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>This graphic presents clear information, but not necessarily deep information. Each section shows a beginning year, an ending year, and some sort of percentage increase. These features all make the message very easy to understand; as the title would clearly 'hint', everything is going up. Life expectancy jumping from 55 to 73 years, renewable energy investment jumps from $88 billion to $363 billion, literacy increases from 69% to 86%, and so on. However, most of these trends really just show two data points with little information of the in between. The data is accurate and properly sourced but lacks any depth.</p>

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>Another issue is that the visualization focuses solely on the outcomes without providing explanation or context to what causes them. For example, life expectancy increases but the visual provides no description or clues to what may have triggered the change. Another graphic shows renweable energy investment rising: to the viewer, we do not know if that is due to policy changes, climate agreements or something else. With no explanation, the graphic presents progress like it is natural and automatic. This weakens the analytical strength of the visualization because viewers are left without the context necessary to interpret the data critically. </p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p>The title of "Things Going Up! Up! Up!" makes the intention clear of showing positive global trends. While the data shown is real, the selection feels very curated. It only includes indicators that improved significantly. It does not include metrics that might hurt the overly narrative, such as carbon emissions, inequality, or political instability. Additionally, the chosen time frames are obviously strategically selected to emphasize upward movement. Choosing a different timeframe for the graphics may have shown a less consistent upward trend. Of course, this does not make the visualization completely misleading, but it does suggest a narrative being shaped by the data selection.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, the visualization is visually appealing and effective at communicating positive trends. It has a simple message of global indiciators improving. It challenges some common pessimistic narratives by highlighting progress in key areas. However, through Tufte's principles, the information resolution is limited, it presents effects without causes,and it cherry-picks overly positive trends. It successfuly tells a persuasive story, but does not provide a comprehensive or elaborate analysis. </p>
